- 👋 Hi, I’m @RegisSantos
- 👀 I’m interested in work with programming, analysis and systems development.
- 🌱 I’m currently working programming languages, with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JS (Node, React, Next, Angular, Typescript, jQuery), PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter), Python (Django) and DB (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
- 📚 I am a student of the Systems Analysis and Development Course, 4nd semester, at Estácio de Sá institution.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on systems development processes, with the knowledge I acquired in courses, gain experience and explore my potential, and, of course, grow professionally.
