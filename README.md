- 👋 Hi, I’m @RegisSantos
- 👀 I’m interested in work with programming, analysis and systems development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming languages, with JavaScript, PHP, Com, MySQL, and I am a student of the Systems Analysis and Development Course, 1st semester, at Estácio de Sá institution.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on systems development processes, with the knowledge I acquired in courses, gain experience and explore my potential, and, of course, grow professionally.
